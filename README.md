# AES

Usage: `python AES128.py`

This program will encrypt a message using AES-128. It currently only encrypts a hardcoded message using 1 round, but I have plans to make users able to encrypt their own messages (and to add the rest of the rounds). 
**DISCLAIMER: DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM FOR PRACTICAL ENCRYPTION OR DECRYPTION. This was designed purely to educate.**
